## Introduce yourself

### Personal
Hi, I’m J.D. Nicholls, a passionate software developer from Medellín, Colombia 🇨🇴.

I thrive on solving problems through technology, optimizing processes, and creating open-source projects that connect people and make a difference in the world. I’m driven by the belief that small contributions can lead to meaningful change, and my work reflects this commitment to innovation and collaboration.

As a developer, I value teamwork and the exchange of knowledge. I love being part of a team where we can create impactful solutions together, share a passion for coding, and continuously improve our approaches to solving challenges. My goal is to develop technologies that are not only effective but also accessible and impactful, reaching millions of users worldwide.

I’m known for being disciplined, organized, humble, and committed to ethical values. I embrace continuous learning, innovation, and the pursuit of optimal solutions, all while maintaining a strong focus on integrity and excellence.

One of my dreams has always been to travel the world, meet new people, and immerse myself in different cultures. To make this a reality, I began working remotely several years ago, allowing me to explore new places while collaborating with diverse teams. These experiences have prepared me for exciting new opportunities and challenges.

I firmly believe that anyone can achieve success with dedication and effort. I’m excited to continue growing, learning, and contributing to projects that make a real impact.

### Professional

I am an experienced Full-Stack Developer, Open Source Contributor and Chainlink Developer Expert with over 12 years of expertise spanning web, mobile, game, blockchain, and cloud development. My career has been defined by building scalable architectures, delivering seamless user experiences, and driving innovation through cutting-edge technologies and Open Source contributions.

As the first Founding Full-Stack Engineer at BAXUS, I established the foundational architecture for their marketplace and mobile app, working closely with the CTO and Head of Business. My contributions included building scalable frontend solutions with React, RemixJS, and Nx, implementing Temporal workflows for orchestrating microservices, and leveraging Docker for streamlined deployments. I also played a key role in the integration of Solana blockchain technologies, enabling secure and transparent transactions, and enhancing the onboarding experience for Web2 to Web3 users through providers like Web3Auth and Magic.link.

Prior to BAXUS, I worked as a Frontend Developer and Team Leader at S4N/Nordstrom, focusing on Employee Selling Tools. I led a team in developing the modular mobile app Nordstrom ON, which enabled employees to generate $4M+ in sales during special events. My role involved designing user-centric interfaces, optimizing app performance, and ensuring seamless collaboration across teams to meet Nordstrom’s high standards for usability and scalability.

After my time at S4N/Nordstrom, I joined Zagalabs, where I played a pivotal role in refactoring Angular/NgRx codebases and developing microservices integrated with third-party providers like Uber Eats. My contributions improved code reusability across web and mobile platforms while enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, I delivered scalable cloud solutions that streamlined operations and supported business growth.

As the creator of Proyecto26, my Open Source organization, I have developed tools like Rest Client for Unity, InAppBrowser for NativeScript, and React Native, with millions of downloads globally, empowering developers worldwide. My passion for sharing knowledge has led me to speak at international events like CityJS, JSConf, and Microsoft DevDays, and mentor local communities such as CodeYourFuture, ColombiaDev, and MedellinJS.

My mission is to use technology to solve complex challenges, create meaningful solutions, and inspire innovation in every project I work on. 

### Hobbies

### STRENGTHS

I think I'm very good at working in a team, I've been doing that since I've been working so I think I've become very good at that. And I believe I have good technical skills using different lenguages and tools and good communication skills.
I'm very responsible, reliable and disciplined person.

### WEAKNESSES

- I get distracted easily and do not feel so motivated when I work alone, for that reason I use to have pair programming meetings with my team, to share knowledge but most important to be focus on my tasks and have a lot of motivation working together.
- Sometimes I used to be stubborn when I knew that something can be done better and I took extra part of my personal time to achieve it, because of that I started giving these points for improvement in retrospective meetings, during the planning of our sprints, to take these into account as part of the estimation process because nothing is perfect, everything can be improved, to avoid procrastination.
- In a job where you have to work under pressure and have to commit to strict deadlines, estimating used to be a complicated task for me, so with experience I began to prioritize tasks and dip complexity into simpler tasks with small deadlines to be more efficient while seeing progress soon.
- I used to be a perfectionist in my work, but with experience working with others I learned that Good is better than perfect, because there's trade-off between being agreeable and being execution oriented, when you move fast, you can be aggresive and frustrate the people who want to get things done too

## Experience

<details>
  <summary><b>Tell me about a situation when you failed</b></summary>

  - Scaling a problem instead of having a direct conversation with my coworker first.
  - I remember once I started on a project that was delayed, having sprints of a week and also I got a hard deadline here. This project was using deprecated libraries and I spent a lot of time updating everything to avoid code refactors in the future, in the end it was a success but I was tired and bored because I had invested a lot of my free time.
</details>

> It's better if you keep iterating and make it better as well as you need instead of trying to make everything perfect the first time, to avoid frustration because nothing will ever truly be perfect **(Perfect is the enemy of good)** and being able to recognize the value of constructive criticism.

  <summary><b>Have you ever worked with an engineer who wasn't performing well?</b></summary>

<details>
  <summary><b>What professional accomplishment are you most proud of?</b></summary>

  - Designed the baseline for cross-platform mobile applications in different companies.
  - At **Yuxi**, I had the opportunity to mentor a junior developer by delegating leadership responsibilities, helping her develop confidence, and take on new challenges to enhance her soft skills. Because at the end of the day it does not matter who the leader is, but rather that we're happy in what we're doing.
  - At my current company I had the opportunity to start working for a Startup that later was acquired by Nordstrom, I had the responsability to investigate new Frontend technologies (Frameworks), migrate some apps and then I defined a modular architecture with **React Native** that today is used for multiple teams. With the help of the team, 2 weeks ago, on the **Nordstrom Anniversary**, the app reached a million dollars in one day, that was impressive!
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>What's your greatest professional achievement?</b></summary>
  
  - My best professional achievement is **Proyecto 26**, I created it with the idea of Changing the world with small contributions, basically Open Source projects that can have a positive impact on the world.
